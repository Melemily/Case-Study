# Case-Study

In this case study, the objective is to create a pricing model that satisfies the new market supply and demand.

I used basic algebraic expressions for the most cut and dry model, however, in the future I would like to optimize with statistical models and even machine learning.

Feel free to build off this model, but please do not copy/paste the report findings.
